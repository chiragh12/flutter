# Calculator App
The Calculator App is a simple Flutter application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations. It provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and other functionalities.


## Features
- Arithmetic operations: Addition, -Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Decimal point support for floating-point calculations
- Percentage calculation
- Change sign (+/-) of the number
- Clearing the input and resetting the calculator (AC)
- Deleting the last entered digit (DEL)
- Evaluating the mathematical expression and displaying the result (=)





## Getting Started
To run the app, you need to have Flutter installed on your system. If you haven't installed Flutter yet, you can follow the installation guide provided on the official Flutter website.
## Clone repository
Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine using either HTTPS or SSH:

```
flutter run
```
This will launch the app on the connected device or emulator.
## How the App work
The Calculator App has a clean and intuitive user interface. The main screen displays two sections: the user input and the result. Users can tap the buttons to input numbers and arithmetic operators, and the input will be displayed in the top section.

Basic Arithmetic: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by tapping the corresponding buttons. The app follows the order of operations to evaluate the mathematical expressions correctly.

Decimal Point: The calculator supports floating-point numbers, and users can input decimal values for precise calculations.

Percentage Calculation: Users can calculate percentages by tapping the "%" button. The calculator will convert the input to a percentage and show the result accordingly.

Change Sign (+/-): The app allows users to change the sign of the number by tapping the "+/-" button.

Clearing Input: Users can clear the input and reset the calculator by tapping the "AC" button.

Deleting Last Digit: Users can delete the last entered digit by tapping the "DEL" button.

Result: When users tap the "=" button, the calculator evaluates the mathematical expression and displays the result in the bottom section.
